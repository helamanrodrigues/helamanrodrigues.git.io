                <p>Here in the home page of youtube, it is observed a clear example of <strong>Visual Hierarchy</strong> where the 
                youtube divided your content with the most to the less relevant content, also have good pattern in the visual
                field when can see some elements that "stand out" like in the left side the bar menu, the other one in the top of the
                right corner that is the log in and the last one that I want to add is the search field in the top of the page with some focus.</p>

                </picture>
                <p>Here in the home page of Airbnb, the site uses the Hick's Law to give for the user a lot of options for things
                to do in the website, here in the main page we have options of places to visit or search for cities, states or even
                countries that we want to check more, we can log in our account and more other stuffs. This is the trick for the site,
                because when you pass more time in the site, better for them, because they will know more about you and also what areas
                they will need to give more attention to improve the site and a lot more benefits, so this method is very useful.

                </picture>
                <p>Here in the home page of Google, we can see one of the best examples in my opinion about white space and clean Design.
                The reason you can observe by ourself, but here in the main page they just had the basic and objective to search, they useful
                very well the white space here and remove all the interferences or distractions with a lot of information that others pages have.
